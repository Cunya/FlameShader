# UI Startup Fix Documentation

## Problem
The UI (GUI) was opening automatically on startup instead of staying closed, which was not the desired behavior.

## Solution
The fix was to explicitly set the initial state of the GUI to closed when creating it:

```javascript
gui = new GUI({ 
    autoPlace: true,
    width: 300,
    title: 'Flame Settings',
    closed: true  // This single line fixed the issue
});
```

## Why This Fix Works
The lil-gui library (which we're using) has a built-in `closed` option that controls the initial state of the GUI. By setting this to `true`, we ensure the GUI starts in a closed state.

## Additional Notes
While the code includes additional GUI state management and event listeners, these were not necessary for fixing the startup issue. The `closed: true` option was sufficient to ensure the GUI starts closed.

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Refresh the page - GUI should stay closed
2. Open and close the GUI manually - should work as expected

## Notes
- The fix preserves all GUI functionality while ensuring it starts closed
- No impact on flame rendering or settings
- Maintains compatibility with existing saved settings
